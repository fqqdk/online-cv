career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Senior Software Developer with more than a decade of experience working in - and on a few occasion leading - agile developer teams
      with a focus on strong Extreme Programming practices (test driven development, pair programming, refactoring, etc),
      an affinity for investigating and fixing complex problems - even more if it concerns legacy code -, and good mentoring skills.
      In my volunteering work I have also collected valuable leadership and organizing skills.

    title: Work experience
    info:
      - role: Senior Software Developer
        time: 2023-08 - Present
        company: SAP Emarsys, Budapest
        details: |
          As a Senior Software Developer my tasks were mentoring the more junior colleagues in the ways of the legacy Automation Center,
          investigating the more complex issues concerning it, and helping the team continuously migrating functionality away from it
          to the new Automation product - a service oriented mesh of services implemented in JavaScript (occasionally TypeScript)
          using Redis, MongoDB and GCP technologies (Pub/Sub, BigTable, BigQuery, etc).
      - role: Senior Software Developer
        time: 2021-07 - 2023-09
        company: SAP Emarsys, Budapest
        details: |
          I spent the better part of two years on a multi-team effort to move all contact data (the most important and largest dataset) 
          from the legacy MySQL tables (across multiple MySQL instances) to the cloud (into Google Cloud Spanner and BigQuery)
          using complex pipelines built of various technologies (from Logstash to Google Pub/Sub and Google Dataflow).
          At the beginning of this period I was the Team Lead of the Core Application Scalability Team for a year.
      - role: PHP Developer
        time: 2014 - 2021
        company: Emarsys Technologies, Budapest
        details: |
          As a PHP Developer on the AC Team we maintained and implemented new features for the (now) legacy Automation Center,
          which is a marketing automation product within the Emarsys Suite, an overly complex system deeply entwined
          in a legacy PHP codebase of millions of LOC - running on equally complex clusters of servers -
          using (and sometimes abusing) technologies such as MySQL, MemCache and occasionally RabbitMQ.
          We frequently had to optimize its performance or scale it various ways and monitor its performance we used the ELK stack (ElasticSearch, LogStash and Kibana).
          At the end of this period I was Team Lead of the AC team for 3 months.
